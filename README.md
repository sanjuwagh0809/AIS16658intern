Task 1 : 1] task 1 - Variable:studied the rule of variable declarion in python .2] task 1- operators : studied various operator in python namely Arithmatic , Assignment,logical,identity,comparison,Bitwise,membership etc .3] task 1 -list : studied the data type list and its method like append remove insert pop sort count accessing , copy reverse and its properties.4] task 1 - tuples : studied how to declear tuple its method like count index etc.5] task 1 -set : set declaration ,properties like mutable , ordered,etc.6] task 1-dictionry: declaration of dict,methods like copy index pop and use of for loop for acceessing 7] task 1 -string : declaration and use of functions like upper lower split strip replace etc.8] task 1-number: substeps like int float and complex,its method.

Task 2 : 1] task 2 - if stmt : use of if statement to check a single condition in various example like to check whether a number is positive
negative,even odd etc.2] task 2 - if else stmt : used to check two condition in example like checking a number is even or odd , greater or smaller , negative or positive and other similar examples. 3] task 2 - if elif else : to test multiple condition at a time if the above condition false then the next one to it tested. studied examples like to ckeck whether number is positive negative or zero and other similar examples.4] task 2 - for loop : used for accessing the elements in a list tuple and its method . 5] task 2 - while loop : use of while  loop to print a sequence of number print.

 Task 3 : In task 3 we studied the break , pass ,continue statement also we studies User defined functions like Satistical like mean , median, mode etc. ahd logical(odd,even,grades)#break - Functionality : when break encounterd inside  loop . the loop stop its execution and cortrol is transferred to the immedately following the loop .Use cas it is useful when you want to exist a loop as soon as certain condition is proceed with the next iteration use case it is usefulwhen you want to exist a loop as soon as  certain condition is met avoidin unnecessary interation # Continue Functionality : When continue is encountered, the current iteration is terminated and the loop proceed with the next iteration .Use case It is useful you want to skip over some parts of the loop but continue with the next iterations for instance you might want to skip over even numbers or any specifice condition within a loop #pass functionality: The pass statement does nothing and is used as a placeholder.Use case It is useful when a statement is synthetically required,but you do not want any action to be taken.Commonly used during development as a placeholder for future code, in empty function or class definations,or within conditional statements where you plan to add code later #Statistical User-Defined Functions : Statistical functions are essentials for data analysis and help summarize and undersand the data's property Mean is used to calculate average of list of numbers Median is use to find the middle value of a list numbers.Mode is used find most frequently occuring values in a list numbers. Variance used to measure spread of numbers in a list from the mean. Standard devation is used to measure the amount of variation or dispersion of set of values . Percentile is used to determine the value below which a given percentage of observationa fall range is used to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in list .interquartile Range (IQR) is used to measure middle 50 % of data . Covariance is used to measure how two variable change together . Correlation Coefficient used to
 measure  the strenght and direction of the relationship between two variables #Logical User Defined Functions #even purpose: Check if a number is even # is odd_Purpose Check if number is odd # Check if number  is prime # Check palindrome purpose etc.

Task 4 : In task 4 we studied all about Numpy library Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data set and working with NumPy functions #NumPy is open sourse project that enables numerical computing with python numPy will always be 100 % open source software and free for all use . We studied 1) creating arrays 2) array indexing  3) slicing 4) NumPy datatypes 5) Copy and View 6) array shape or reshape 7) array iterting 8) join splits, sort and filter . Here 1D array,3D array and multidimensional array are studied Numpy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one cheracter like i for integers,u for unsigned integers etc # Then we learn how to generate Random Number NumPy offers the random module to work with random numbers #Data disribution is a list of all possible values,and how often each value occurs Such lists are important when working with Statistical and data science .The random module offer methods that return randomly generated data distributions. Then we see that generation of random numbers from particular distribuction and visuallisation  of that distribution like Normal distribution ,binomial distribution ,poission distribution ,unifrom distribution ,
logistic distribution , mutinomail,exponential,chi squre etc.To plot the graph of distributons #from NumPy import random #import matplotlib pyplotas plt #import seaborn as sns.Then we use ufuncs stands for "Univeral Functions" and they are NumPy functions that operate on the ndarray object .We studied ufunctiuons like simple arithmatic,                                                      roundindecimals,log,summations,products,differences,finding,lcm,gcd,trignometric functions,hyperbolic function and set operations.

Task 5 : In task 5 we Pandas library Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data set and working with Pandas functions.We Create a simple Pandas DataFrame, we the load the CSV into a DataFrame.we create a dataframe using the metrix,using the dictionary.we using the dataframe operation like value counts,apply, unique nunique,describe.pandas provides various function to manipulate data including selection, filtering ,grouping, and merging.In pandas we learn how to find the missing values in the data. also we learn how to drop the column or row in the dataset. we also learn the how to fill the missing values in the data using the mean and median.

Task 6 : In task 6 we Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static,animated,and the  interactive visualizations in the python. It is highly customizable and capable of producing publication-quality figures.Matplotlib allows you to create a wide range of plots including line plots,scatter plot,bar charts,histograms ,boxplot.In these we create all types graphs .we learn the how to show label in the graphs and also we learn the give the legend in the graph.Seaborn is a python data visualization libary based on the Matplotlib.It provides the informative statistical graphics.
