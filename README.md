Task 1 : 1] task 1 - Variable:studied the rule of variable declarion in python .2] task 1- operators : studied various operator in python namely Arithmatic , Assignment,logical,identity,comparison,Bitwise,membership etc .3] task 1 -list : studied the data type list and its method like append remove insert pop sort count accessing , copy reverse and its properties.4] task 1 - tuples : studied how to declear tuple its method like count index etc.5] task 1 -set : set declaration ,properties like mutable , ordered,etc.6] task 1-dictionry: declaration of dict,methods like copy index pop and use of for loop for acceessing 7] task 1 -string : declaration and use of functions like upper lower split strip replace etc.8] task 1-number: substeps like int float and complex,its method.

Task 2 : 1] task 2 - if stmt : use of if statement to check a single condition in various example like to check whether a number is positive
negative,even odd etc.2] task 2 - if else stmt : used to check two condition in example like checking a number is even or odd , greater or smaller , negative or positive and other similar examples. 3] task 2 - if elif else : to test multiple condition at a time if the above condition false then the next one to it tested. studied examples like to ckeck whether number is positive negative or zero and other similar examples.4] task 2 - for loop : used for accessing the elements in a list tuple and its method . 5] task 2 - while loop : use of while  loop to print a sequence of number print.

 Task 3 : In task 3 we studied the break , pass ,continue statement also we studies User defined functions like Satistical like mean , median, mode etc. ahd logical(odd,even,grades)#break - Functionality : when break encounterd inside  loop . the loop stop its execution and cortrol is transferred to the immedately following the loop .Use cas it is useful when you want to exist a loop as soon as certain condition is proceed with the next iteration use case it is usefulwhen you want to exist a loop as soon as  certain condition is met avoidin unnecess
